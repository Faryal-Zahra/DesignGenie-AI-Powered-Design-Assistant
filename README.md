### 📌 About

AI-powered web app that generates and optimizes design suggestions from user inputs using a modular MVC architecture.

---

### 🚀 Features

* 🔧 Input constraint validation
* 🎨 AI-generated visual design suggestions
* ♻️ Design regeneration without restarting
* 💾 Export final design as image (e.g., PNG)
* 📈 Optimized output based on backend AI logic
* 🧩 Follows MVC architecture for scalability
* ✅ Tested with Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
* 👥 Built using Agile methodology with Trello & GitHub

---

### 🛠️ Architecture

Follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern:

* **Model** – Manages input data and AI logic for generation/optimization
* **View** – User interface for input, feedback, and downloads
* **Controller** – Connects frontend interactions with backend logic

---

### 📚 User Workflow

1. Select category: *Architecture*, *Product*, or *Prototype*
2. Enter design constraints (size, shape, material)
3. AI generates and optimizes the design
4. Preview and regenerate if needed
5. Export final design

---

### 🧪 Testing

Used **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** to validate input ranges for:

* Architecture design dimensions
* Product size and quality
* Prototype dimensions
